# Cancer_Cell_Prediction_System
Frontend implementation of a Hybrid CNN–Liquid Neural Network system for lung cancer histopathology classification. Enables image upload, real-time prediction (Benign, LUAD, LUSC), probability display, and Grad-CAM++ visualization. Built as part of my undergraduate thesis integrating deep learning with interpretable AI.
